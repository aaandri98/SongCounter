# SongCounter
a Java program useful to take several songs' lyrics and compare them, finding equalities in them. the output will be divided in csv files.

This is a program which I developed for a student of Education of the Free University of Bolzano. 
He wanted a program which was able to count the frequence of the words in a song's text, in order to calculate their impact on the song.
With the same program, I helped another student of the same faculty to work towards his bachelor's thesis.

In order to use the program, it is only needed to upload the songs' text in the "testicanzoni" folder.
The texts must be in a .txt format, and having as file name "artist - song title".

After the execution, the program will give an output in the "output" folder, which contains several .csv files, 
one for each song and one for each artist, plus a total output, which contains all the words in the texts.

Each file is sorted by the number of occurrences.
